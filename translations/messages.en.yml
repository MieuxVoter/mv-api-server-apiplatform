        tally:
            description: |
                Tally of a poll such as `1,4,7/4,3,5`.
                It's the amount of judgments received per grade, per proposal.
                It is built like so: `<proposal a> / <proposal b> / …`.
                And for each proposal: `<worst grade amount>, …, <best grade amount>`.
            example: "1,3,5,4,2,4,3/5,3,1,2,4,4,3/6,2,0,3,5,4,2"
