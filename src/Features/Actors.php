/**
 * A bag of Actors in our feature suite.
 *
 * With this class as an injected dependency of your FeatureContexts, it will be shared between them.
 * We *know* that shared contexts are stinky.  So are files of more than a few hundred lines of code.
 * Do share your suggestions and insights :)
 *
 * Most of the time there will be only one Actor per Scenario: 'I'.
 * But sometimes it is necessary or handy to use multiple Actors.
 *
 * Each Actor gets its own:
 * - [x] API client
 * - [x] transaction log
 * - [ ] response data object
 * - [?] response crawler
 * - â€¦
 *
 * Really not sure we're going to use the "current actor" business. Hence, it's there but commented out.
